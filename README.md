I am Italian and I currently live in the Netherlands. I graduated in Masterâ€™s Degree Computer Engineering - Embedded and Control Systems at the [University of Pavia](https://web.unipv.it/) in 2017.

Even if my university career was mainly focused on Embedded Systems, I got passionate about Python, SQL and how to use data to solve problems so I decided to completely change my working field approaching Data Engineering and Data Science.

After working some years as an employee as a Technical Consultant and as a Data Engineer I decided to start working exclusively as a remote independent contractor/freelancer.

On my website [simonerigoni.net](http://www.simonerigoni.net), on [Medium](https://medium.com/@simone-rigoni01) and on [Blogspot](https://simonerigoni01.blogspot.com/) about personal projects, software development, data engineering and data science related topics. If you like the content I create feel free to buy me a [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/simonerigoni).
